## üéØ Security Expertise

In the realm of **Capture The Flag (CTF)**, I have honed my expertise in web application security through platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. Whether it's deciphering complex vulnerabilities or crafting custom exploits, I enjoy delving deep into systems to discover weaknesses and optimize security.

As a **bug bounty hunter**, I have reported vulnerabilities to several platforms, contributing to enhanced security across a variety of applications. With hands-on experience in **penetration testing** and **vulnerability assessment**, I bring a hacker's mindset to the forefront, always on the lookout for ways to break and then fix security systems.
