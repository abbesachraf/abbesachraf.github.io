# About Me

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/routeburn.jpg" | absolute_url }}" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast specializing in **CTF competitions**, **bug bounty hunting**, and **exploit development**. With a background in **IT** and **web development**, I thrive in environments that challenge my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

In the realm of **Capture The Flag (CTF)**, I have honed my expertise in web application security. Whether it's deciphering complex vulnerabilities or crafting custom exploits, I enjoy delving deep into systems to discover weaknesses and optimize security.

As a **bug bounty hunter**, I have reported vulnerabilities to several platforms, contributing to enhanced security across a variety of applications. With hands-on experience in **penetration testing** and **vulnerability assessment**, I bring a hacker's mindset to the forefront, always on the lookout for ways to break and then fix security systems.

My **web development** skills complement my security expertise, enabling me to build and understand the applications I aim to protect. Fluent in modern web technologies, I build secure and scalable web applications while identifying potential risks during development.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **Information Technology**, expanding my knowledge in areas such as network security, cloud computing, and system architecture. I actively participate in online cybersecurity communities and consistently update myself with the latest tools and techniques in the field.

I am always eager to take on new challenges in cybersecurity, working on **offensive security**, improving **exploit development** techniques, and helping organizations strengthen their defenses.
