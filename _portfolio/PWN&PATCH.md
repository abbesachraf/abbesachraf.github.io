# PWN&PATCH Internship: Red Team Pentest Environment

During my internship at **PWN&PATCH** in Tunis from June 2024 to September 2024, I developed a red team pentest environment specifically designed for recruitment interviews. This project aimed to enhance the practical assessment of candidates' cybersecurity skills by simulating real-world attack scenarios.

### Project Overview

**Objective**: The primary objective of this internship project was to create a realistic pentesting environment that could be utilized to evaluate the technical skills of candidates applying for cybersecurity roles. This environment enabled interviewers to conduct hands-on assessments of a candidate's ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

### Features

- **Red Team Pentest Environment**: Developed a fully functional environment that mimics a real-world IT infrastructure, allowing candidates to perform penetration testing.
- **Active Directory Lab**: Created an Active Directory setup that simulates various attack techniques, including:
  - Password attacks
  - Privilege escalation
  - Lateral movement
- **Assessment Tools**: Integrated various tools and scripts to facilitate pentesting activities, providing candidates with a comprehensive assessment experience.
- **Documentation**: Provided detailed documentation and user guides for candidates to understand the environment and the expected tasks during the interview.

### Key Technologies

- **Operating System**: Deployed on Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **Security Tools**: Utilized tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite for penetration testing.
- **Virtualization**: Employed virtualization technologies (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware) to create isolated environments for testing.

### Usage

The pentest environment allows interview candidates to perform security assessments in a controlled setting. Candidates are given specific objectives and must demonstrate their ability to use various tools and techniques to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

### Team Collaboration

This project was developed in collaboration with the PWN&PATCH team, who provided insights into the recruitment process and the specific skills needed for cybersecurity roles.

### Performance Metrics

The red team environment was successfully utilized in multiple recruitment interviews, receiving positive feedback for its realism and effectiveness in assessing candidate skills.

### Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Scenarios**: Add more complex scenarios that simulate advanced attack techniques and multi-stage attacks.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring tools to observe candidate activities during the assessment.
- **Automated Feedback**: Develop a system for providing candidates with instant feedback on their performance and areas for improvement.
