# CI/CD Pipeline for "tp foyer" Application üåêüöÄ

## Overview
Welcome! This project showcases a CI/CD pipeline I created for the "tp foyer" application. It was developed as an academic project, combining my interests in DevOps and cybersecurity with a focus on secure, efficient, and monitored deployment processes.

**Note**: If you're interested in a full exported version of this project, please feel free to contact me!

## Project Goals
The primary goals for this project were to:
- **Automate** the entire development, testing, and deployment cycle.
- **Secure** the pipeline to prevent vulnerabilities at every stage.
- **Monitor** the application in real time for efficient incident response.

## Architecture & Tools üõ†Ô∏è
For this pipeline, I used a selection of DevOps tools to achieve reliable and secure CI/CD:

- **Git**: Version control to keep track of code changes.
- **Maven**: Manages compilation and dependencies.
- **JUnit/Mockito**: Unit testing for code reliability and accuracy.
- **SonarQube**: Analyzes code quality and security vulnerabilities.
- **Nexus**: Artifact repository for hosting project artifacts.
- **Docker & DockerHub**: Containerization for consistent deployment.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages container orchestration and dependencies.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Real-time performance monitoring and visualization.

## Pipeline Stages üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. **Source Code Management with Git**
   - **Git** tracks code changes and facilitates collaboration. Each commit automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy the latest code.

### 2. **Build with Maven**
   - **Maven** automates the build process, handling code compilation and dependency management. This step ensures that the codebase is consistent, and dependencies are up to date.

### 3. **Testing with JUnit and Mockito**
   - **JUnit and Mockito** run unit tests to validate code functionality, catching bugs early in development.

### 4. **Code Quality & Security with SonarQube**
   - **SonarQube** performs static code analysis to detect code quality issues and security vulnerabilities, aligning the project with secure coding best practices.

### 5. **Artifact Management with Nexus**
   - After a successful build and testing phase, artifacts (e.g., JAR files) are pushed to **Nexus**. Nexus serves as a repository, allowing seamless artifact management and access in later stages.

### 6. **Containerization with Docker & DockerHub**
   - The application is **containerized** with Docker, creating a standardized environment for deployment.
   - Containers are stored in **DockerHub**, making them accessible for deployment in various environments.

### 7. **Container Orchestration with Docker Compose**
   - **Docker Compose** manages multiple containers, handling dependencies between different services and ensuring the app runs consistently across environments.

### 8. **Real-Time Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**
   - **Prometheus** monitors the application‚Äôs performance and health metrics.

   - **Grafana** provides a visual dashboard to track CPU usage, memory, response time, and more, enabling proactive monitoring and quick response to issues.
