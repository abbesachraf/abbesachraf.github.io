# ADVANCIA Internship: Implementing Windows LAPS

During my internship at **ADVANCIA** in Tunis from July 2023 to September 2023, I focused on improving system security by implementing Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS). This project significantly enhanced password management across the organization.

### Project Overview

**Objective**: The main goal of this internship project was to enhance the security of organizational systems by implementing Windows LAPS. This solution helps in managing local administrator passwords, ensuring they are unique and rotated regularly.

### Features

- **Windows LAPS Implementation**: Successfully deployed Windows LAPS across the organization's systems, allowing for centralized management of local administrator passwords.
- **Password Security**: Improved password security by ensuring that each system has a unique local administrator password, reducing the risk of credential theft.
- **Reduction of Forgotten Password Incidents**: Achieved a **90% reduction** in forgotten password incidents, which streamlined IT support operations and increased overall productivity.
- **User Training**: Conducted training sessions for staff to educate them on the benefits and usage of Windows LAPS, ensuring smooth adoption.

### Key Technologies

- **Operating System**: Windows Server
- **Management Tools**: Utilized Group Policy Management for deploying LAPS.
- **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation for the deployment process and user guides.

### Usage

The implementation of Windows LAPS allows IT administrators to manage local administrator accounts efficiently while minimizing the risk of password-related security breaches.

### Team Collaboration

This project involved collaboration with the ADVANCIA IT team, ensuring that all security policies were adhered to and the implementation met organizational standards.

### Performance Metrics

The deployment of Windows LAPS led to significant improvements in system security, as evidenced by the drastic reduction in password-related support tickets and incidents.

### Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Other Security Solutions**: Plan to integrate LAPS with additional security solutions to further enhance password management and auditing.
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Develop a monitoring system to continuously track the effectiveness of LAPS and adjust policies as needed.
